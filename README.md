🎨 Background Artwork
The background image was AI-generated by NightCafe using a custom prompt:

anime fantasy landscape of a glowing lotus pond at night with 
mystical water plants floating across it, 
illuminated lotus flowers gathered in the center of the pond glowing blue, shimmering water, 
surrounded by reeds and grasses, distant dark forests in silhouette, 
soft purple twilight sky with fading sunset glow and bright stars, 
atmospheric dreamy lighting, ethereal magical aura, painterly anime style, 
highly detailed, fantasy concept art

This ensures the artwork is non-copyrighted and belongs to this project.
